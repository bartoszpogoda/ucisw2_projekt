  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Peak Memory Usage:  215 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Pack:1186 - One or more I/O components have conflicting property values.
    For each occurrence, the system will use the property value attached to the
   pad.  Otherwise, the system will use the first property value read.  To view
   each occurrence, create a detailed map report (run map using the -detail
   option).

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s500e' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network XLXI_10/InitOK has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 5 more times for the following
   (max. 5 shown):
   XLXI_10/B1_Status<7>,
   XLXI_10/B1_Status<6>,
   XLXI_10/B1_Status<5>,
   XLXI_10/B1_Status<4>,
   XLXI_10/B1_Status<3>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal Clk_50MHz are pushed forward
   through input buffer.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   6 block(s) removed
   7 block(s) optimized away
   6 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "XLXI_10/InitOK" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_10/B1_Status<7>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_10/B1_Status<6>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_10/B1_Status<5>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_10/B1_Status<4>" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_10/B1_Status<3>" is sourceless and has been removed.
Unused block "XLXI_10/B1_Status_3" (FF) removed.
Unused block "XLXI_10/B1_Status_4" (FF) removed.
Unused block "XLXI_10/B1_Status_5" (FF) removed.
Unused block "XLXI_10/B1_Status_6" (FF) removed.
Unused block "XLXI_10/B1_Status_7" (FF) removed.
Unused block "XLXI_10/InitOK" (SFF) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XLXI_10/XST_GND
VCC 		XLXI_10/XST_VCC
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
MUXCY 		XLXI_17/Madd_current_enemy0.Y_add0000_cy<0>
MUXCY 		XLXI_17/Madd_current_enemy0.Y_add0001_cy<0>
MUXCY 		XLXI_17/Madd_current_enemy0.Y_add0003_cy<0>

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
